This program is run in Colab without the use of a GPU.

In this notebook, we will use DDPG to determine the optimal execution of portfolio transactions. In other words, we will use the DDPG algorithm to solve the optimal liquidation problem. But before we can apply the DDPG algorithm we first need to formulate the optimal liquidation problem so that in can be solved using reinforcement learning.
